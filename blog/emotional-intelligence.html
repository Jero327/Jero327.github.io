        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h3>11 September 2023</h3>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.” - Salovey and Mayer 1990
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Daniel Goldman, one of the 'founders of the era of Emotional Intelligence', cites studies that find emotional intelligence twice as important as IQ in one's work environment. And that the higher up the ladder you go, the more critical it becomes - meaning that the differentiating factor among people who are at a reasonably high level at a company is not IQ, but EQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research shows six factors distinguish top performers from average performers within the tech sector. Note how 4/6 factors pertain to EQ, not IQ.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Achievement drive and standards</li>
          <li>Influence</li>
          <li><em>Conceptual Thinking</em></li>
          <li><em>Analytical Ability</em></li>
          <li>Initiative</li>
          <li>Self-Confidence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          “For those in leadership positions, emotional intelligence skills account for close to 90 per cent of what distinguishes outstanding leaders from those judged as average.” Kemper 1999
        </p>
        <p>
          The emotional intelligence piece shows up once you get to the higher levels, even in more formal workplaces like the Navy.
        </p>
        <p>
          EQ bring in “A deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind… not a mere pleasurable feeling, a fleeting emotion, or a mood, but an optimal state of being.” Matthieu Ricard
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          The world is a changeable, complex, uncertain, and ambiguous place. And being human is tough. We've got all these complexities in life - pressures of work, pressures of being at Dev Academy. We're learning a huge amount of stuff really quickly... and we're human with complex minds and complex emotions! EQ helps us work well in this complex world. Cultivating emotional intelligence is one way of helping us in this complex world, helping us as we study at Dev Academy, and helping us work in the wider world.
        </p>
        <p>Three primary benefits of strengthening EQ:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stellar Performance</li>
          <li>Outstanding Leadership</li>
          <li>Happiness</li>
        </ul>
