          1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

          Situation Description:
          In a previous job, I encountered an ethical decision while working as a project manager at a technology company. We were in the final stages of developing a new software product when we discovered a critical security vulnerability that, if not addressed promptly, could lead to the exposure of sensitive customer information.

          Values Consideration:
          This decision involved multiple values, including security, customer trust, honesty, and company reputation. Addressing the vulnerability might require additional time and resources, but not addressing it could jeopardize customer privacy and harm the company's reputation.

          Decision-Making Process:
          I began by discussing the severity of the vulnerability and potential consequences with team members. I then consulted with the company's security team and legal advisors to understand potential solutions and legal implications. I also considered our contractual commitments to customers, along with the company's values and mission.

          Decision and Rationale:
          Ultimately, I decided to prioritize the resolution of the vulnerability as the top task in the project. Despite the potential for project delivery delays, I believed safeguarding customer privacy and the company's reputation were paramount. I shared my decision internally with the team, explaining the rationale behind it, and ensured their understanding and support.

          Reflection:
          Looking back, I believe it was the right decision. We successfully addressed the security vulnerability, customer trust remained intact, and the company benefited from our commitment. This experience emphasized to me the importance of values in decision-making and deepened my understanding of the value of teamwork and consultation.

          Personal Growth:
          This experience contributed to my personal growth, teaching me to stay composed and resolute under pressure and conflict. I also learned the significance of balancing competing values in decision-making and the importance of having a clear understanding of potential consequences. I believe this experience will continue to influence my future decisions and professional ethics.

          Conclusion:
          This example illustrates how I navigated competing values in a workplace scenario, made an ethical decision, and gained insights from the experience. It positively impacted my personal growth and professional development, reinforcing my commitment to ethical decision-making.

          2.Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

          Cultural Influence: Confucianism, also known as Ruism or Ru classicism, is a system of thought and behavior, which teaches me how to be behave myselfes and influence others in properly manners;

          Family and Upbringing: Harmony, contentment, optimism, tenacity, unity, support;

          Education and Peers： knowledge, logic, humanities, nature, cooperation, vision;
