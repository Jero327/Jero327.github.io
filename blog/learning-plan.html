        <h2>1.	What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My long-term career goal is to be a good web developer.</p>
        <h2>2.	A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>I possess several strengths that have proven beneficial. Firstly, I excel in logical thinking, enabling me to analyze and solve complex problems effectively. Additionally, I have a knack for connecting diverse pieces of knowledge into a cohesive network, facilitating a deeper understanding of subjects. Furthermore, my meticulous nature ensures that I pay attention to detail, reducing the likelihood of errors in my work.
        However, I do acknowledge certain limitations in my learning process. One significant challenge is my difficulty in pinpointing the most suitable learning resources for a given topic. This can lead to inefficient use of my study time. Moreover, I struggle with time management, occasionally prioritizing less important tasks over my learning objectives. Another area where I can improve is my ability to collaborate with others in a learning setting. While I value comprehensive understanding, my tendency to delve into every aspect of a subject can sometimes hinder efficiency. Nonetheless, I am committed to addressing these limitations to enhance my overall learning experience.</p>
        <h2>3.	What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>During my time at Dev Academy, I am eager to develop and enhance several essential non-technical core skills that are crucial both in learning and the workplace. Firstly, I aspire to improve my collaboration skills significantly. While individual work can yield quick results, I believe that true progress and innovation often arise from collective efforts, and I want to contribute effectively within teams.
        Secondly, I aim to sharpen my time management skills. Efficiently allocating my time to tasks and projects will not only boost productivity but also reduce stress and ensure a healthy work-life balance.
        Furthermore, I recognize the importance of effective communication in any field. I want to refine my communication skills, both written and verbal, to convey ideas and information clearly and concisely, fostering better collaboration and understanding.
        Lastly, I intend to bolster my resource-searching abilities. In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, being adept at finding relevant information and resources is invaluable. By honing this skill, I can stay up-to-date and continuously improve my knowledge and capabilities.</p>
        <h2>4.	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
        <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
        <p>To ensure productive and safe collaboration with fellow learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives, I will adhere to a structured approach. Before commencing tasks, I'll establish clear learning objectives, create a well-structured timeline, and allocate workloads effectively. Throughout the process, I will maintain open and timely communication, providing progress updates and seeking assistance when encountering challenges. After completion, I will conduct thorough self-assessment, analyzing both problems and solutions. This reflective practice will help identify areas for improvement and ensure a continuous cycle of growth. Such a systematic approach will not only maximize productivity but also foster a collaborative and safe learning environment for all involved.</p>
        <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
        <p>When things start building up and becoming overwhelming, I'll employ a structured approach. Firstly, I'll proactively assess and allocate workloads in advance, creating effective task-time plans. Tasks will be broken down and prioritized to ensure efficient progress. If a specific subtask encounters delays, I'll shift my focus to other high-priority subtasks while maintaining open communication with relevant parties. If necessary, I'll attempt to renegotiate timelines within the feasible scope. This approach enables me to manage stress and workload effectively, ensuring that I can maintain productivity and collaborate smoothly with others even when facing challenging situations.</p>
        <h2>5.	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>When facing challenges that I cannot overcome within the recommended time, I will promptly seek assistance from both facilitators and fellow learners. Additionally, if I find myself confused or struggling with established learning objectives, I will proactively engage in communication with facilitators to clarify doubts and seek guidance. This commitment ensures that I will prioritize seeking help in a timely manner to facilitate effective learning and problem-solving.</p>
        <h2>6.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>As we're still in the second week of our learning journey, my expectations are not yet fully defined. However, I hope that the facilitation team can take the time to understand each learner's uniqueness, considering their diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and goals. Tailoring communication and guidance based on individual differences will greatly contribute to our learning experience.</p>
        <h2>7.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>I don't have any specific commitments that require dedicated scheduling, except for essential daily life activities and one hour of exercise. I can effectively utilize almost all of my available time for learning without any major interruptions or obligations.</p>
