        <h3>21 September 2023</h3>
    
        <h2>1. were blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>what was the problem?</li>
          <p>'pre' Tag cause the web page can not be responsive from mobile device.</p>
          <li>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Trying something</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
          </ul>
          <li>how did you feel throughout the process?</li>
          <p>Why? Why? Why? At first just can not understand why that single html page can not be responsive. Firstly, Googling but with no luck; Then read one by one line code as comment out 
            some code block, and finnally found out the reason is 'pre' Tag.
          </p>
          <li>what did you learn?</ li>
            <p>
              If there is something works as unexpected, that's means there must be somethong wrong or special from others, be patient and walk through problem-solving techniques, there must be a solution.
            </p>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>what was the problem?</li>
          <p>When working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation of HTML elements, I encountered a problem. There was a button with 
          an event listener attached to it, designed to add a 'li' element to a container every time it was clicked. Additionally,
          each 'li' element had its own event listener. The issue arose when testing the event listeners on the 'li' elements, 
          as they were not functioning as expected.</p>
          <li>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
          <p>To address this challenge, I employed various problem-solving techniques. I started by conducting online searches to 
          gather insights and solutions. I also used the 'Rubber ducky method,' a technique where I explained the problem step by
          step as if teaching it to someone else, which often helped me identify the root cause. However, the most effective 
          technique I utilized was 'console.log.' Placing 'console.log' statements at different points within the code allowed 
          me to trace the execution sequence and pinpoint the exact location where unexpected behavior occurred. This significantly
          expedited the troubleshooting process.</p>
          <li>how did you feel throughout the process?</li>
          <p>Throughout this problem-solving journey, I experienced a mix of frustration and curiosity. Frustration emerged when I 
          couldn't immediately identify the issue, but curiosity motivated me to explore different approaches and learn from the debugging process.</p>
          <li>what did you learn?</li>
          <p>Ultimately, I learned a valuable lesson: when attaching event listeners to dynamically created elements like 'li' elements,
          it's crucial to place the listener within a parent event handler, rather than outside of it. This ensures that the event
          listener is properly bound and executed, leading to the desired functionality. This experience not only improved my debugging 
          skills but also reinforced the importance of efficient problem-solving techniques in programming."</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <p>I've never used this technique, but it's shows up as a pratical methodology, so I'm definetly trying out when there is a chance</p>
          <li>Trying something</li>
          <p>100%</p>
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          <p>50%. This method should work very well upon leave good comments when coding.</p>
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          <p>75%. Sometimes can not get a idea from the error message, but just copy and paste into search engine, the most of times there would be a solution.</p>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <p>100%</p>
          <li>Googling</li>
          <p>100%</p>
          <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
          <p>50%. I will try to seek help from Discord channel.</p>
          <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
          <p>100%</p>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          <p>60%. Maintain notes system helps a lot.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
        <p>I tend to rely on the internet and machine resources to seek answers, often attempting to solve problems independently. While this approach can
           be useful, it sometimes consumes a significant amount of time. Reflecting on this, I realize that I have been reluctant to ask for help from others 
           due to a desire to prove my self-sufficiency. However, I now recognize the value in seeking assistance when needed.</p>
        <p>In the future, I plan to change my approach. I will make an effort to formulate my questions more clearly and seek guidance from resources like
          Discord channels or mentors. I understand that reaching out for help can expedite problem-solving and provide valuable insights that I might have
          missed on my own. This adjustment will not only save time but also enhance my learning and collaborative skills."</p>
